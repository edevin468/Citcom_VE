### Contents of this repository:
- CitcomVE code (C) 
- input files
- processing codes (Python)
- some figure codes (Python)

### Current configuration:
See manuscript for details on viscosity structures, geometry, wavelengths, and periods.  

#### In the data:
Each period is denoted by "c" followed by a number between 0 and 32 (e.g. `c01`).  `c01` corresponds to a loading period of 320 &tau. 


Results will be saved to folders named in the inputfile `datafile` field.
